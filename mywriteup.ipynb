    "### Files Submitted & Code Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Submission includes all required files and can be used to run the simulator in autonomous mode\n",
    "\n",
    "My project includes the following files:\n",
    "* model.py containing the script to create and train the model\n",
    "* drive.py for driving the car in autonomous mode\n",
    "* model.h5 containing a trained convolution neural network \n",

    "## step1:采集数据及数据预处理\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 用udacity提供的模拟器采集数据：其中注意点\n",
    "\n",
    "1.尽量保持车辆在路中间行驶；\n",
    "\n",
    "2.跑两遍以上地图；\n",
    "\n",
    "3.容易出错路段，比如急转弯，多采集几遍；\n",
    "\n",
    "4.采集逆向行驶数据；\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 数据预处理\n",
    "\n",
    "1.设计网络模型的时候，添加一个lambda层，对每张数据做归一化和均值中心化处理\n",
    "\n",
    "model.add(Lambda(lambda x: x/255.0-0.5,input_shape=(160,320,3)))\n",
    "\n",
    "2.数据增广\n",
    "\n",
    "2.1 将每张图片作镜像处理，这样可以增加图片数量，也可以平衡向左/右行驶习惯；\n",
    "\n",
    "2.2 将左/右摄像头数据，都加入训练，对图片做适量修正，这里简单取+0.2\n",

    "### Design Model Architecture and Training Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. An appropriate model architecture has been employed\n",
    "\n",
    "My model consists of 3 convolution neural network with 5x5 filter sizes ,2 convolution neural neetwork with 3x3 and depths between 24 and 64 (model.py lines 134-140) \n",
    "\n",
    "The model includes RELU layers to introduce nonlinearity (code line 34), and the data is normalized in the model using a Keras lambda layer (code line 128). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Attempts to reduce overfitting in the model\n",
    "\n",
    "The model contains dropout layers in order to reduce overfitting (model.py lines 135). \n",
    "\n",
    "The model was trained and validated on different data sets to ensure that the model was not overfitting. The model was tested by running it through the simulator and ensuring that the vehicle could stay on the track.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Model parameter tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "The model used an \"adam\" optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually (model.py line 158).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Appropriate training data\n",
    "\n",
    "Training data was chosen to keep the vehicle driving on the road. I used a combination of center lane driving, recovering from the left and right sides of the road,and flip all images\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Architecture and Training Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Solution Design Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall strategy for deriving a model architecture was to ...\n",
    "\n",
    "My first step was to use a convolution neural network model similar to the LeNet. I thought this model might be appropriate because LeNet works wonderfully in Traffic classify project.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to gauge how well the model was working, I split my image and steering angle data into a training and validation set. I found that my first model had a low mean squared error on the training set but a high mean squared error on the validation set. This implied that the model was overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "To combat the overfitting, I modified the model to add a Dropout layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "however, the vehicle can't work well in some place. So I decide to change the CNN architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the process, the vehicle is able to drive autonomously around the track without leaving the road.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Final Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "instead, use the Net Architecture by NVIDA'S autonomous vehicle team.\n",
    "\n",
    "add a Dropout layer to avoid overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final model architecture (model.py lines 18-24) consisted of a convolution neural network with the following layers and layer sizes ...\n",
